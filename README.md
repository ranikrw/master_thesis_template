# Master Thesis Template 

This repository provides a template for crafting your master's thesis. It is important to note that master's theses can vary greatly in format; the structure within this template serves merely as one example.

To utilize this template in Overleaf, start by downloading the file 'master_thesis_template.zip'. Next, click on 'New Project' within Overleaf, select 'Upload Project,' and then choose the downloaded ZIP file.

This template uses the Norwegian format. To switch to English, modify the language at the top of the 'setup.sty' file.

Please let me know if you find errors in the template or if you have suggestions for improvements.
